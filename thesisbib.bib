	AuRal is an environmental audio system in which individual participants form ad hoc ensembles based on geolocation and affect the overall sound of the music associated with the location that they are in.
	The AuRal environment binds physical location and the choices of multiple, simultaneous performers to act as the generative force of music tied to the region. Through a mobile device interface, musical participants, or agents, have a degree of input into the generated music essentially defining the sound of a given region. The audio landscape is superimposed onto the physical one. The resultant musical experience is not tied simply to the passage of time, but through the incorporation of participants over time and spatial proximity, it becomes an aural location as much as a piece of music. As a result, walking through the same location at different times results in unique collaborative listening experiences.},

In this paper we discuss amethod of sharing a computer music instrument's interface with anaudience to allow them to interact via their smartphone. We propose amethod that is relatively cross-platform and device-agnostic, yetstill allows for a rich user-interactive experience.

The more computers involved the longer the setup and tear-down of a performance. Each computer adds power and cabling requirements that the venue must accommodate. Cloud computing can change of all this by simplifying the setup of many (10s, 100s) of machines at the click of a button. But there's a catch, the cloud is not physically near you, you cannot run an audio cable to the cloud. The audio from a computer music instrument in the cloud needs to streamed back to the performer and listeners. There are many solutions for streaming audio over networks and the internet, most of them suffer from high latency, heavy buffering, or proprietary/non-portable clients. In this paper we propose a portable cloud-friendly method of streaming, almost a cloud soundcard, whereby performers can use mobile devices (Android, iOS, laptops) to stream audio from the cloud with far lower latency than technologies like icecast. This technology enables near-realtime control over power computer music networks enabling performers to travel light and perform live with more computers than ever before.},

	Abstract                 = { Cloud computing potentially ushers in a new era of computer music performance with exceptionally large computer music instruments consisting of 10s to 100s of virtual machines which we propose to call a `cloud-orchestra'. Cloud computing allows for the rapid provisioning of resources, but to deploy such a complicated and interconnected network of software synthesizers in the cloud requires a lot of manual work, system administration knowledge, and developer/operator skills. This is a barrier to computer musicians whose goal is to produce and perform music, and not to administer 100s of computers. This work discusses the issues facing cloud-orchestra deployment and offers an abstract solution and a concrete implementation. The abstract solution is to generate cloud-orchestra deployment plans by allowing computer musicians to model their network of synthesizers and to describe their resources. A model optimizer will compute near-optimal deployment plans to synchronize, deploy, and orchestrate the start-up of a complex network of synthesizers deployed to many computers. This model driven development approach frees computer musicians from much of the hassle of deployment and allocation. Computer musicians can focus on the configuration of musical components and leave the resource allocation up to the modelling software to optimize.},

An overview of mobile musicprojects is presented using the categories that describe the main activities:projects that explore the influence and make use of location; applications thatshare audio or promote collaborative composition; interaction using wearabledevices; the use of mobile phones as performance devices; projects that exploreHCI design issues. The relative activity between different types of activity isassessed in order to identify trends. The classification according totechnological, social or geographic showed an overwhelming bias to thetechnological, followed by social investigations. An alternative classificationof survey product, or artifact reveals an increase in the number of productsdescribed with a corresponding decline in the number of surveys and artisticprojects. The increase in technical papers appears to be due to an enthusiasmto make use of increased capability of mobile phones, although there are signsthat the initial interest has already peaked, and researchers are againinterested to explore technologies and artistic expression beyond existingmobile phones.},

Applications written in JavaScript and designed torun in the browser offer remarkable performance, mobile/desktop portability andlongevity due to standardization. Our research examines the use and potentialof native web technologies for musical expression. We introduce two librariestowards this end: Gibberish.js, a heavily optimized audio DSP library, andInterface.js, a GUI toolkit that works with mouse, touch and motion events.Together these libraries provide a complete system for defining musicalinstruments that can be used in both desktop and mobile browsers. Interface.jsalso enables control of remote synthesis applications by including anapplication that translates the socket protocol used by browsers into both MIDIand OSC messages.},

The tools provide a means for composers working in the Pure Data composition environment to design and audition performances using ensembles of mobile phones. These tools were developed as part of a larger project motivated by the desire to allow large groups of non-expert players to perform music based on just intonation using ubiquitous technology. The paper discusses the process that replicates a Pure Data patch so that it will operate within the hardware and software constraints of the Java 2 Micro Edition. It also describes development of objects that will enable mobile phone performances to be simulated accurately in PD and to audition microtonal tuning implemented using MIDI in the j2me environment. These tools eliminate the need for composers to compose for mobile phones by writing java code. In a single desktop application, they offer the composer the flexibility to write music for multiple phones. },
